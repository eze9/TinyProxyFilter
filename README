The script loads config form the regex folder and then compares the url
domain content and content-type to decide what to do with it

Eg: You want to blacklist a publicity website that is poping some anoying
windows there are 3 ways to remove that content from the page.

1.- Domain based blacklist
	to do this you just need a regular expression to blacklist that domain.
	lets say we want to blacklist www.adbucks.com, to do this we will edit
	the domain.rxp file on the regex folder and add

	.*adbucks.*

	This of course will block all connections from adbucks

2.-	Url based blacklist
	This is the second method to blacklist we follow the previous procedure
	but instead we edit url.rxp, lets pretend we want to browse a website
	that has some really anoying javascript but we dont need to blacklist
	them all eg: http://www.somesite.com/path/to/ads/anoying.js

	http://www.somesite.com/path/to/ads/anoying.js
	or
	.*/ads/.*.js
	or
	*.js
	and so on
